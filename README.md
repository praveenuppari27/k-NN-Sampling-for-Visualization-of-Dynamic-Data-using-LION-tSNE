# k-NN-Sampling-for-Visualization-of-Dynamic-Data-using-LION-tSNE
"k-NN Sampling for Visualization of Dynamic Data using LION-tSNE" revolves around the application of advanced data analysis techniques to address the challenges of visualizing dynamic datasets.In this context, k-NN Sampling, which selects a representative subset of data points, is combined with LION-tSNE, a variant of t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), known for its exceptional dimensionality reduction capabilities. By integrating these methods, the project aims to create a practical solution for visualizing and understanding how data evolves over time. This achievement not only demonstrates proficiency in data science but also contributes to the field by offering a valuable tool for gaining insights from ever-changing datasets, which can be instrumental in various domains, including machine learning, data visualization, and trend analysis.
